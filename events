		<h3>Invitations</h3>
		<p>One to two months before you plan to host an event or party, you should compile your guest list.  I love to evite my guests. I love paperless since they send out reminders and can help the host with a tally. Make sure that your guest totals are accurate, sometimes people don’t put down all the family members that will be attending.  Be careful to compare your written list with your evite list because sometimes people unintendedly get left out.
		</p>

		<h3>Prepping your outside for your party</h3>
		<p>As soon as your invitations go out, start coming up with a plan to tackle any projects that need tending to inside and outside your home. I find outside parties to be the hardest because you want to tackle any weeding around your home. Try to get those hedges or bushes neatly trimmed.  In the spring, I try to spread around new mulch. If you keep up with putting down mulch every year, the less weeding you will have to do. You also want to make sure you have outdoor lighting.  I love string lights. One time when I was visiting the city of Miami, I saw all these neat little alleys with tons of string lights. It was a big eye catcher. You want to make sure you have solar lanterns spread throughout your yard. The more inviting your outdoor space looks, the more time your guests will want to be outside. You want to think about what time of year you will be hosting your event. Does it get chilly at night?  You may want to invest in an outdoor heater or check out rental options. If the part is outside, you may want to put on your invitation that jackets would be recommended.
		</p>

		<h3>To tent or not to tent?</h3>
		<p>I love tents outside. We invested in a cheap tent on Amazon a few years ago and it has been so worth it. I love how it define areas. You may even want to get 2 tents one for your food stations and one for your seating area. I love to hang a chandelier from the top of the tent to add extra outdoor light.  We have a black wrought iron looking one that we bought years earlier from KMart. We use an extension cord and white duct tape (to match the color of the poles) to place the cord inconspicuously around the upper poles and run down a side so it is not so noticeable. I also love incorporating paper lanterns or more string lights depending on the theme of my party. These can also be battery powered, which can save you from the hassle of extension cords. 
		</p>
		
		<h3>Serving</h3>
		<p>I love to use 6-foot rectangle tables for food service. You want to plan out how many serving racks you can fit on one table. My friend has awesome stainless catering serving trays, which are very pricey but provide a professional look to your party. The downside is you will need to figure out where to store them. I personally have done most of my parties with the cheap serving racks. They work just fine because they are easy to stacked and tucked away. You want to think about your menu and come up with a plan before planning the tables and serving layout. I like to have one to two tables for appetizers and salads. Don’t forget that you want to have your condiments nearby. Make sure you have plenty of plates, napkins and utensils near your food as well as tongs on hand. I also highly suggest that serving spoon are placed near each serving tray so that my linens or table doesn’t get dirty from the serving utensils.	
		<br><br>
		I love plastic for parties.  Who wants to be washing anymore dishes than you need to.  I go to BJ’s before a party and buy sternos for serving trays.  You want to get large serving aluminum pans and half pans.  I like the Berkley and Jensen brand they fit perfectly in the racks.  You can use the pans for leftovers later.  I buy colored plastic or heavy duty paper plates for my event and maybe colored or white napkins.  I buy at least 2 or 3 boxes of plastic utensils.  They never have enough knives in one box.  You want to have at least two serving caddies for napkins and utensils, one near the appetizers and salads and the other near your entrees.  You want to put two sections of forks with knives in the middle section of the utensil caddy, save the spoons for the desserts and coffee. Later on you can grab one of the caddies for your dessert table.  
		<br><br>
		The best thing to do is get out all of the serving trays and bowls and display on your table ahead of time. I like to put stickies on each platter or bowl so I know where everything is going to go when it comes out of the oven or fridge. This makes things so much easier if you have a waiter/waitress or friend/family member that can lend a hand. They know exactly where everything goes. It is also a great reminder to not forget something in your fridge or oven. 
		</p>

		<h3>Decorations</h3>
		<p>I love to use white linens. I get my linens directly from Yankee Linen Company in Paterson, NJ.  You can call a few days in advance and they are very helpful in informing you on what sizes you need.  I can run over and pick up the tablecloths neatly wrapped and ready to go.  
		<br><br>
		I love to use round tables for seating if you have the space or rectangle tables if space is more limited. You can line up 2 rectangle tables right next to each other and make a square and seat 12 chairs around this.  You may want to look into renting some unusual chairs, ene though I usually opt for the cheapest option (such as the traditional white folding chair). Nowadays, they have so many chairs that may be worth the elevated elegance. See what your budget may allow.  
		<br><br>
		I love to use the white linens on the serving and seating tables because this allows me to incorporate color with flowers. I am crazy about flowers. Every party has flowers that match a color scheme for my party and event. The magic number is three: you always want to incorporate three colors. Using various shades of one color also works to further  Let’s say if you are having a baby girl’s christening, I would use a light pink, bubblegum pink and a white. For an anniversary party, I’d use the timeless white, silver and gold. 
		<br><br>
		For the flowers, I love using unusual vases as a centerpieces. My favorite combination is a square vase on round tables because it offers some contrast.  You can also arrange mason jars with bunches of flowers and tied with a ribbon or a thin piece of burlap with some tea lights to make the table look festive. Keep in mind your centerpiece height as well because, more times than not, a tall centerpiece will be move it to the  floor because your guests cannot see across the table. I like to arrange one centerpiece and then sit down and see if I can see someone across the table. 
		<br><br>
		While flowers can get expensive, there are plenty of budget-friendly options.  My favorite place to buy flowers is at my local supermarket. They have a nice selection and are extremely reasonable. You can buy one or two more expensive flowers for each centerpiece and use filler for the rest. I normally use unusual greens as filler. 
		<br><br>
		Always  think about personalizing your party for every event. I love incorporating photos at each table of whomever the honoree is.
		</p>

		<h3>Menu</h3>
		<p>I love to make individualized menus that fit every person and event. Always have a theme in mind. For example, at my son’s Eagle Scout dinner, I thought about hearty foods like meats and potatoes and s'mores to create a camping feeling.  I always try to think about the honoree of the party and their favorite foods. You always want to have vegetarian options with some seafood and assorted veggies and salads. I like to have assorted meats such as beef, pork and chicken. The décor is important but awesome food and plenty of beverages are crucial. 
		<br><br>
		You want to have your appetizers ready to go the moment your party starts. It’s always to best to have cold appetizers that are easy to pop right onto your table. Cheese and crackers, a caprese platter, or dips and spreads. However, you should not neglect hot appetizers. You many want to offer some assorted meatballs in some crock pots that you can put on the table and put on low in advance. Make sure your appetizer table is near a plug if you do the crockpot option. I love to set up a salad bar so people have options and can choose their own toppings. You can chop up all the toppings in baggies and place in the fridge to be pulled out at the last minute. I love to have a large bowl of chopped romaine and another bowl of spring mix greens. You can leave out two tongs next to the bowls with assorted dressings and the toppings in matching bowls with spoons. Plastic bowls work great for the salads, but I love using pasta bowls for the toppings since they are wider. I usually clear the appetizer table and then turn that into the dessert table and order an extra tablecloth to put a fresh tablecloth on the dessert table. 
		<br><br>
		My family loves desserts and if I left out the desserts beforehand all of the cookies would be gone way before dessert. I put all of my dessert platters aside and ready to be brought out with all of the baked goods. People love small bites for dessert. I used to buy large sheet cakes and would have tons of leftovers. I now either purchase a medium sized themed cake to go with my event or I bake one and do cookies, cupcakes and a fruit platter. Some fan favorites are an ice cream bar with all of the toppings such as candies, crushed up cookies and different syrups. Another favorite is a chocolate fondue with chopped up pound cake and fruits. 
		<br><br>
		If you are having a large crowd it’s so hard to make all of the food on your own. You want to come up with a plan for things you will be making and the dishes you will need to order. It’s always best to make the salads on your own. Sometimes we have hosted an event and have done the hamburgers and hot dogs and everyone else brought a side dish, appetizer, beverage or dessert. People are happy to help out the host. A lot of times, we have done a group email so all the people coming could see where there is a need for more of something or are happy for you to assign them something to bring. 
		</p>		

		<h3>Things to keep in mind</h3>
		<p>
		Usually my rule of thumb for quantity is if you have 50 people you will want to have 5 full trays of your entrée. 100 people = 10 trays and so on.  Don’t forget to have kid friendly options, chicken fingers and mac and cheese are always great, even for the big kids at heart.
		<br><br>
		Before your party you want to take inventory of your serving platters, serving utensils having plenty of paper towels and dish cloths and pot holders readily available. Don’t forget your stickies to label your platters and bowls for easy access to assemble your appetizers and desserts. You may need to borrow some extra serving bowls and platters from friends and neighbors.
		<br><br>
		If you are able to have a wait staff help you, you should give them an overview of your kitchen so they know where everything is easily.
		<br><br>
		You always want to have an empty fridge before a party to put all of the food that you will need the day of your party. We try to eat up everything before our party.  It’s called our clean up the fridge and freezer week. An empty freezer will help store all that ice cream if you decide to have an ice cream bar. You want to have a clean fridge before a party, so I give mine a good wipe down before I head to the store to buy all the food. I also self clean my ovens before I host a party. Nothing is worse than the smell of burning crumbs from a dirty oven.  
		<br><br>
		I like to have my appetizers ready to go at the start of the party. I like to have all of my entrees ready to go 90 minutes after the start of the party. I always set mental goals so that I can enjoy my guests company. Let’s say my party starts at 2:00pm. I would start clearing the appetizers around 3:20pm, put on a fresh linen, straighten up the salad bar table and add anymore toppings and then have the entrees all ready to go at 3:30pm. I like to have the desserts ready to go around 5:30pm so I start clearing up the food around 5:00pm and consolidate all of the empty trays and maybe leave out a little in one or two trays for very late arrivals. Once the dessert table is set up I don’t really worry about clearing it since I love to have all of the desserts gobbled up. Let’s say you are having a party that may run late into the evening since you have out of town guests staying late or kid’s friends stopping by after the family party, I like to have some ready made options available to them. I love offering popcorn and s'mores around a fire pit and some pizza bagels and little hot dogs which can all be popped in the oven easily.
		</p>

		<h3>Beverages</h3>
		<p>Depending on the weather and the size and time of the event, large amounts of beverages can be consumed. If you are having your party on a warm day, you want to have at least 3-4 bottles of waters for each guest. Another option is to get multiple gallons of water and fill up a water dispenser. I like to have lemons next to my water dispenser for people to add to their waters. I also like to have a dispenser filled with lemonade and another one of iced tea for the kids and non-alcoholic drinkers. I have one table set-up aside for beverages and dispensers. You may want to have large tubs of ice with wines in them and then coolers next to the table with assorted beers. I like to label my coolers with what is in them. You should have a cooler with domestic beers and then another one with the imported beers, or even a keg for each one. Just make sure the tap is working beforehand. You want to make sure you have your corkscrews and bottle openers at the table and plenty of cups. I like small plastic glasses for the wine and larger colorful solo cups for the non-alcoholic drinks and the keg. Make sure someone stops by this table to straighten up, it gets messy with all of the empty wine bottles. You may want to have a recycling can off to the side or a sign that says there is a recycling can under the table. You also want to h we did a slideshow for our parent’s 50th anniversary and incorporated some of their favorite tunes over the years.
		</p>

		<h3>Garbage</h3>
		<p>Make sure you have a lot of garbage pails on hand and a lot of garbage bags. I like the heavy duty contractor bags for parties which you can find at your Home Improvement Stores. They fit in the garbage pails nicely. You want to label your garbage pails for recycling and regular trash to keep all of the garbage separated. Sometimes I even borrow some extra pails from my neighbors.
		</p>

		<h3>Parking</h3>
		<p>You may want to talk to your neighbors before you have a party.  Sometimes our neighbors would let us park  cars in their driveways.  Neighbors are sometimes happy to oblige, especially if they are away for the weekend and want to look like someone is home.  We also use our side yard as my husband parks one car diagonally for the rest of the guests follow.  Some towns don’t allow parking after certain hours so you may want to inform your guests to move their car. Send out a reminder to your guests that there are stop signs near your home as to not forget the parking rules.  Nothing is worse than a guest getting a parking ticket while at your party.
		</p>

		<h3>Take care of yourself before the party</h3>
		<p>I try to treat myself a few days before a party and try to fit in a pedicure or manicure.  I also like to get a blow out the day before my party and take a shower the night before with a shower cap on.  I do a lot of running around before the party starts but once my guests come, I use them as an asset. I normally change right as my guests come because I can delegating them simple tasks. Getting ready beforehand can lead to you ruining your close or makeup. Instead, I preheat my ovens and ask my guests to watch the food as I change. If your clothes are ready to go, it makes the process go very smoothly. I am able to put my makeup on as my food is heating up, which allows me not to waste a second. 
		</p>

		<h3>Pets</h3>
		<p>You may want to look into finding a place for your pet to spend the day. When you have a big party, the last thing you want to worry about is your dog eating something he shouldn’t, jumping on guests, or scaring little ones that aren’t used to having a dog around. Make these plans in advance because professional places often book up. Sometimes asking a friend to let my dog stay at their house can also be just as simple. It is one less thing to worry about. 
		</p>

		<h3>Kids</h3>
		<p>If kids are having fun at your party, then all of the adults are having fun.  I always try to have some type of entertainment available for kids of all ages. We have a swing set up in the backyard. In the past, we have rented an inflatable rock climbing wall and bounce houses. You can keep things simple with a slip and slide or a kiddie pool. On special occasions, we have an outdoor movie screen that we bought on Amazon and we play kids movies on it. You want to keep the kids as busy as possible so their parents can enjoy the party.
